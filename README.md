This is an ongoing project regarding to the second chapter of my PhD
thesis, in which I will build occupancy models for three focal species:
the maned wolf (*Chrysocyon brachyurus*), the gray brocket deer (*Subulo
gouazoubira*), and the giant armadillo (*Priodontes maximus*). We will
provide the steps for occupancy analysis using Bayesian inference, which
will lead land prioritization for conservation.
