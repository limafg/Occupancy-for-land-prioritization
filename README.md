This is an ongoing project regarding to the second chapter of my PhD
thesis, in which I will assess spatial and temporal overlap of three
focal species: the maned wolf (*Chrysocyon brachyurus*), the gray
brocket deer (*Subulo gouazoubira*), and the giant armadillo
(*Priodontes maximus*). We will relate their activity patterns to the
presence of cattle and human disturbances, which will lead management
and land prioritization for conservation.
